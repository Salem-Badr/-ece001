People are confused about whether or not artificial intelligence will help humans or destroy them.

<ul>The bright side of Artificial Intelligence:</ul>
</body>
<body>
<ul>Among the positive changes that accompany artificial intelligence are the rapid increase in productivity and achievements of mankind by enhancing existing skills, providing the best customer service, improving the pace of employment and choosing employment. New types of jobs will emerge and the robot and other machines will perform daily routine tasks in a professional manner, saving time and effort for employees to waste them on simple things. As for consumers, they will benefit from artificial intelligence in the form of improving services, providing recommendations and quality with high efficiency in addition to making substantial and tangible changes in industries such as health care, transportation and medicine in a safer way. Of course, human life will change for the better from the presence of self-driving cars and the expansion of this technology to other means of transportation such as trains, ships and airplanes. It is expected that companies will reduce many expenses thanks to artificial intelligence and its applications that are increasing day after day, in addition to the new innovations and innovations that accompany this technology that will strongly affect daily life. As with any emerging technology that appears in the light, the controversy over artificial intelligence is raised from time to time. There are many industries that have caused widespread controversy when they appear, such as cars and airplanes.</ul>

<ul>The opaque side of Artificial Intelligence:</ul>
</body>

<ul>In the coming years, artificial intelligence will raise three questions. The first will affect jobs, given that companies and the industrial and service sectors are moving toward this technology to cut costs by cutting labor. Artificial intelligence can carry out customer service and human resource functions. According to the McKinsey study, 375 million jobs or 14% of the global workforce may be automated by 2030. And the second question: â€œHow will privacy be protected with the spread of artificial intelligence? This question enters the scope and circulation of data on the Internet and tracks human behaviors digital moment by moment. And artificial intelligence will allow customers, employees and consumers to be monitored effectively and learn about their behavior, but at the same time, it will violate their privacy and data. Countries like China use artificial intelligence to monitor citizens with criminal records and learn about the behavior of others with aggressive and criminal inclinations, and therefore, new legislation will be needed to regulate this. The third question is about the effects of artificial intelligence on competitiveness in the business sectors where many companies try to add tools supported by artificial intelligence to enhance their productivity and the skills of their employees and provide good services. And when all companies accelerate the application of this technology at a widespread pace, this may adversely affect competitiveness, as the services will be similar from one company to another. Among the dark aspects of artificial intelligence is the possibility of increasing monopoly in some industries outside the technology sector by attracting the greatest amount of technical talent and killing creativity in the human element. It is too early to talk that the positives of artificial intelligence will outweigh its negatives, for years to come will determine that, but surely, this technology will make major changes in human lives.</ul>
