Artificial Intelligence is the study of how to make computer do things which at the moment people do The better. primary goal of artificial intelligence is to improve computer behavior so that it can be called intelligent. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of study based on the premise that intelligent thought can be regarded as a form of computation. To achieve this, two major issues need to be addressed. The first issue is knowledge representation, and the second is knowledge manipulation. Within the intersection of these two issues lies mechanized intelligence. AI combines precision and computational power with pure logic, to solve problems and reduce error in operation. Already, robot expert systems are taking over many jobs in industries that are dangerous for or beyond human ability. I highlight that the potential applications of Artificial Intelligence are abundant. They stretch from the military for autonomous control and target identification, to the entertainment industry for computer games and robotic pets.
